# EventTrackerProject
#### Description
This project was designed to track your workouts, whether that is a strength session, a recovery session or an endurance session. Whenever you perform a workout, you are able to log the Name of the workout, the Implement used during the workout (dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, etc), the primary lift that was executed, the sets and repetitions that were performed, the duration of the workout and the accessory work performed for that session. This project was designed so that you can input anything between Endurance work, recovery work and main work. That means you do not always have to enter all of the details of the session, except for the name of the session. If you are simply performing a recovery session or an endurance session, you can simply enter "Lacrosse Ball" for the implement used or "Concept2 Rower" if you are performing an endurance training session. This week, we were required to update this project using JavaScript to build a front end for the project. Now, when the application and run, the user will be greeted with a webpage instead of going through PostMan to verify that there is full CRUD. My webpage shows a heading of Event Tracker! From there, the user can input an ID of the workout they would like to retrieve. If there is no workout that can be retrieved, there will a return of "Workout not found." Additionally, there is a button that allows the user to show all workouts. There is also an option from there to delete a workout by the ID along with update a workout using the ID. Additionally, there is an option to view the total number of workouts in the database that changes dynamically when a workout is updated or deleted.

### Lessons Learned
This was the first project that I created that used RESTful API (which stands for representational state transfer) along with JPA to create a full CRUD (CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that works for every operation. This means that you can query every workout, you can look for an individual workout by ID, you can input a workout, you can update a workout by changing a section of the workout that needs to be updated, and you can delete a workout from the database. The lessons I learned from this project was how much more efficient and easy RESTful API's can be when you are using it correctly. I also felt like this project taught me the in's and out's of using REST and how it interacts with the other pieces of the program. I definitely feel like this project helped me cement my understanding of all of the functions of REST and made me feel much more confident in my abilities in not just REST but in Java also. I am very excited to see how much more can be done using this technology. UPDATE: The lessons I learned during this weeks project were very much the same as the previous week in that I was able to apply the things I learned during the week to further perform CRUD operations with DOM manipulation. That specific part of the project really helped me further understand how things can be done in many different ways and using JavaScript to perform CRUD operations was very interesting. The concepts of this weeks material were further solidified through this project.

### Technologies Used
The technologies used for this project were REST, JPA, SpringToolSuite, MySqlWorkbench, Terminal, MacBook Pro, SpringBoot, MAMP and the PostMan. UPDATE: Additionally, this week we used JavaScript to design the frontend allowing the user an additional way to manipulate the database.

What was fun?
What was fun during this project what that I feel very much more confident in my abilities with Java and REST. It was very fun to see that I was able to not only complete the required functions, but once I could tell that something wasn't working exactly how I wanted it, I was able to play around with the code while knowing what I was doing. When things would't work, I did not immediately know how to fix it, but I did know what I needed to check on to find the answer. Also, I knew where to look to find the answer to the issue. Overall, this was a very fun project and it further helped me in my understanding of what is required of me in future projects. This project was fun but also it was incredibly challenging for me to get everything working. It definitely feels like the rollercoaster is going up again.
