# EventTrackerProject

### Description

This project was designed to track your workouts, whether that is a strength session, a recovery session or an endurance session. Whenever you perform a workout, you are able to log the Name of the workout, the Implement used during the workout (dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, etc), the primary lift that was executed, the sets and repetitions that were performed, the duration of the workout and the accessory work performed for that session. This project was designed so that you can input anything between Endurance work, recovery work and main work. That means you do not always have to enter all of the details of the session, except for the name of the session. If you are simply performing a recovery session or an endurance session, you can simply enter "Lacrosse Ball" for the implement used or "Concept2 Rower" if you are performing an endurance training session. In order to see the list of all the workouts in the database, you simply go to api/index. In order to see a workout by Id, you simply need to go to use the route api/workoutId/1 (this will show you the workout with the ID of 1, all you need to do to see others, is change the ID you are searching for.) using a GET request for those two functions. In order to add a workout to the database, you simply need to perform a POST request with the route api/workout/workoutName and perform a JSON entry in the sent Body of the route without adding a workout ID (this will be automatically assigned). This will add a workout to the database and show you the generated ID along with the information you sent. This is very similar for Updating a workout, however you need to perform a PUT request with the ID of the workout you wish to update api/workout/# (# would be the ID of the workout you wish to update). Then you use the JSON body again to send the updated information to the database. Once you send the request, you will be shown the workout with the updated information. In order to Delete a workout from the database you need to send a DELETE request with the route api/workout/4 (this will delete the workout with the ID of 4). This can be done with any ID in the database. If you receive a 204 message back, that workout was successfully deleted. If you receive a 404 in return, that just means there was no workout to delete by that ID. 

### Lessons Learned

This was the first project that I created that used RESTful API (which stands for representational state transfer) along with JPA to create a full CRUD (CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that works for every operation. This means that you can query every workout, you can look for an individual workout by ID, you can input a workout, you can update a workout by changing a section of the workout that needs to be updated, and you can delete a workout from the database. The lessons I learned from this project was how much more efficient and easy RESTful API's can be when you are using it correctly. I also felt like this project taught me the in's and out's of using REST and how it interacts with the other pieces of the program. I definitely feel like this project helped me cement my understanding of all of the functions of REST and made me feel much more confident in my abilities in not just REST but in Java also. I am very excited to see how much more can be done using this technology.

### Technologies Used

The technologies used for this project were REST, JPA, SpringToolSuite, MySqlWorkbench, Terminal, MacBook Pro, SpringBoot, MAMP and the PostMan

### What was fun?

What was fun during this project what that I feel very much more confident in my abilities with Java and REST. It was very fun to see that I was able to not only complete the required functions, but once I could tell that something wasn't working exactly how I wanted it, I was able to play around with the code while knowing what I was doing. When things would't work, I did not immediately know how to fix it, but I did know what I needed to check on to find the answer. Also, I knew where to look to find the answer to the issue. Overall, this was a very fun project and it further helped me in my understanding of what is required of me in future projects.
